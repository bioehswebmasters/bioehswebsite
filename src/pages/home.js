          <p>
            Recognize outstanding UC Berkeley Bioengineering undergraduates for
            their academic excellence. Alongside strong scholastic achievements,
            the society promotes exceptional character and encourages members to
            engage in volunteer work, professional development, and community
            events.

          <p>
            While applicants to Bioengineering Honor Society must meet minimum
            grade standards and apply for membership, many of our activities are
            open to all undergraduates. We feel this will give new
            undergraduates a chance to get to know the Bioengineering major,
            career, and peers before deciding to join our society. Please feel
            free to join us at advertised events and socials.
